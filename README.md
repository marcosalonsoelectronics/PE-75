Material of video PE #75: Dynamic Response of DC-DC Converters under Hysteretic Control

Available at: https://youtu.be/KqZnS7O6j6k

This video investigates the dynamic response of DC-DC converters under hysteretic control. Qspice simulations are shown to illustrate the different concepts. It is shown how the hysteretic control is much faster than other control methods that operate at constant frequency, like the voltage-mode control or current-mode control. In hysteretic control there is no sampling effect because the ton and toff times, and switching period act as analog variables. The dynamic response of the buck converter under hysteretic control is the same as that of the averaged circuit up to the Nyquist frequency, which is half of the switching frequency at the operating point.
